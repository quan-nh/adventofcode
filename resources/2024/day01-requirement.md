Summary by LLM:

The story involves a Christmas adventure with the Elvish Senior Historians searching for the missing Chief Historian. The core puzzle is about comparing two lists of location IDs and calculating the total "distance" between them. Here's how the distance calculation works:

1. Sort both lists in ascending order
2. Pair up the numbers from each list in order (smallest with smallest, second smallest with second smallest, etc.)
3. For each pair, calculate the absolute difference between the numbers
4. Sum up all these differences to get the total distance

Key points:

- This is part of a quest to collect 50 stars by solving puzzles
- The goal is to find the Chief Historian before Christmas
- The specific puzzle requires calculating the total distance between two lists of location IDs
- The distance is calculated by pairing and measuring the difference between corresponding sorted numbers

Example calculation:

- Given lists: Left [3,4,2,1,3,3], Right [4,3,5,3,9,3]
- After sorting: Left [1,2,3,3,3,4], Right [3,3,3,4,5,9]
- Pair distances: |1-3|=2, |2-3|=1, |3-3|=0, |3-4|=1, |3-5|=2, |4-9|=5
- Total distance: 2+1+0+1+2+5 = 11

The puzzle asks you to perform this calculation on the actual input lists to determine the total distance.
